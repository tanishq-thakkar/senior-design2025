## **Design Constraints Essay**

Our UniSync project—an AI-powered voice assistant for University of Cincinnati students—operates under multiple design constraints that influence our technical, ethical, and development decisions. These constraints guide us toward building a reliable, compliant, and student-focused system.

---

### **1. Economic Constraints**
We are limited to student-accessible tools such as AWS Educate, open-source packages, and university cloud credits. This restricts scale, compute capacity, and high-volume API usage.  
To operate within budget, we plan to:

- Optimize cost through efficient model usage
- Apply caching and rate-limited request handling
- Use modular deployment to scale only when necessary  

---

### **2. Professional Constraints**
The project contributes directly to our growth as engineering professionals. We must apply real industry practices in AI development, collaboration, and documentation.  

Our approach includes:

- Code reviews and version control best practices
- Clear and maintainable documentation
- Ethical and reliable software engineering standards  

---

### **3. Ethical Constraints**
AI systems risk bias and misinformation, so fairness and inclusivity are critical. We will:

- Test outputs for bias and ensure response neutrality
- Maintain transparency in data usage
- Promote respectful, inclusive communication at all times

---

### **4. Legal Constraints**
Handling student data requires strict compliance with university policy and U.S. regulations such as **FERPA**. We commit to:

- Avoiding unauthorized access to proprietary APIs
- Using properly licensed datasets and open-source libraries
- Ensuring consent-based authentication for student systems

---

### **5. Security Constraints**
UniSync may interface with systems containing personal, academic, or scheduling data. To prevent misuse or data exposure, we will implement:

- Token-based authentication
- Encrypted data transmission
- Minimal data retention and PII-free logging  

---

### **6. Social Constraints**
UniSync is built to enhance digital life on campus by reducing friction between everyday tools. It supports accessibility and student success by:

- Delivering quick, real-time information
- Reducing stress and time spent navigating multiple apps
- Increasing engagement and academic organization

---

### **7. Environmental Constraints**
AI workloads consume energy and compute resources. To remain sustainable, we plan to:

- Use energy-efficient, scalable cloud infrastructures
- Optimize our model to avoid unnecessary compute cycles
- Prefer serverless deployments to reduce idle resource usage

---

### **8. Cultural & Diversity Constraints**
UC's campus is globally diverse, so accessibility is a core requirement. We will work to ensure UniSync can serve every student by supporting:

- Multilingual and accent-tolerant voice recognition
- ADA-compliant UI and interaction design
- Cultural neutrality in information retrieval and responses  

---

## **Conclusion**
While UniSync’s development is shaped by economic, ethical, legal, professional, environmental, and cultural constraints, these limitations guide us toward responsible innovation. These boundaries ensure that our system is secure, inclusive, sustainable, and aligned with both university expectations and modern engineering standards.
