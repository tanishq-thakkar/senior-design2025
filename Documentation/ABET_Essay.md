UniSync Project – Design Constraints Essay
Our UniSync project, an AI-powered voice assistant for University of Cincinnati students,
faces several design constraints that shape our technical, ethical, and social
decisions. Economically, we are limited by access to free or university-supported tools
such as AWS Educate, open-source frameworks, and student-tier cloud credits. This
restricts our scalability and API usage, but we plan to mitigate these issues through cost
optimization, model caching, and modular deployment to ensure functionality within
budget.
From a professional standpoint, this project directly impacts our growth as future software
engineers. It requires applying industry standards in AI design, documentation, and agile
teamwork while reflecting our professional responsibility to produce reliable, maintainable,
and ethical software. We plan to uphold these standards through code reviews, proper
version control, and clear documentation.
Ethically, UniSync must safeguard fairness and prevent bias in responses. AI systems
often inherit bias from training data, so our team is committed to testing model outputs for
neutrality, maintaining transparency in data handling, and ensuring that all interactions are
respectful and inclusive.
On the legal side, our project must comply with university and federal data protection laws,
including FERPA. We also ensure that no copyrighted data or proprietary APIs are used
without authorization. We will rely on open data sources and ensure that all datasets and
libraries are properly licensed for educational use.
Security is a major constraint because UniSync interfaces with sensitive student systems
like Canvas or Corq. We are implementing encrypted communication, token-based
authentication, and minimal data storage. Logs will exclude any personal identifiers,
aligning with privacy standards and reducing the risk of breaches.
From a social perspective, UniSync aims to enhance campus life by simplifying access to
academic and event information. It supports inclusivity by serving as a digital assistant that
saves time, reduces stress, and increases student engagement. By providing accurate,
real-time responses, UniSync contributes to student success and community connection.
Environmental considerations also play a role, as AI systems can consume significant
computing resources. Our approach includes using energy-eOicient cloud services and
optimizing our model to reduce unnecessary compute cycles. Deploying in scalable,
serverless environments minimizes idle energy consumption and contributes to
sustainable computing.
Finally, diversity and cultural impact are core to our design. UC’s student body is globally
diverse, so we aim to make UniSync accessible to users with diOerent linguistic, cultural,
and accessibility needs. Features such as multilingual support, accent-tolerant speech
recognition, and ADA-compliant interfaces will ensure that every student can benefit
equally from the assistant.
In conclusion, while UniSync’s development is bounded by economic, professional,
ethical, legal, security, social, environmental, and cultural constraints, these limitations
drive our team to innovate responsibly. They ensure that the system we create is secure,
inclusive, sustainable, and aligned with the values of both the University of Cincinnati and
the broader engineering profession.
