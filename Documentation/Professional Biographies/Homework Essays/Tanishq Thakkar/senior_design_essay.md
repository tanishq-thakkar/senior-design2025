# Senior Design Essay

**Paragraph 1 – Introduction**  
For my senior design project, my group is creating an AI powered voice assistant designed specifically for University of Cincinnati students. From an academic point of view, this project is an excellent opportunity to combine cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing into a singular end-to-end system. Realistically, the voice assistant will be able to answer personal questions, like "When's my next calculus class?" by connecting securely to the student's calendar and learning management platforms. The assistant will incorporate multiple AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock, Transcribe, and Polly, to provide a seamless voice interface. As a computer science major, I see this project as an accumulation of a clearly defined product that incorporates knowledge and skills acquired in my coursework and cooperative work experience. Furthermore, the end-product could potentially provide value to thousands of other students. In addition to technical implementation of the voice assistant, the project allows me to enhance my software engineering principles, collaboration, and communication (other fundamental skills for any successful career).

**Paragraph 2 – College Curriculum**  
My computer science program at the University of Cincinnati has provided me with the depth to approach this daunting project. The underpinning for efficient data management was built in CS2029C *Data Structures and Algorithms* and CS4071 *Database Management Systems*, and data management will be exceedingly important as we create scalable back-end systems for calendar and course data storage. I learned about the underlying protocols and concepts for enabling real-time communication in CS4065 *Computer Networks*, as well as the principles which underpin distributed systems, relevant to deployment on AWS in CS5152 *Cloud Computing*. Furthermore, I learned about core algorithms, the empirical methods used to evaluate machine learning algorithms, and the principles for deciding among multiple algorithms in class CS4091 *Machine Learning*, which I expect will be useful as we adopt SageMaker to explore customized models. I have maintained that general education and writing-intensive coursework has developed my ability to communicate complex ideas in a clear manner, which I will draw on when documenting and presenting our project. I expect that these combined academic experiences will provide not just technical expertise, but a well-rounded approach to addressing this design challenge.

**Paragraph 3 – Co-op Experiences**  
My co-op experiences have enhanced my academic studies by granting me hands-on exposure to actual software engineering. At Sensforge, as a Software Engineer Intern, I assisted in the development of enterprise applications, where I learned how to integrate large language models into business's systems. At Phillips Edison & Company, I experienced maintaining and extending MRI enterprise software, focusing on the user experience of enterprise software as well as its backend reliability. At Archer, I contributed to full-stack development efforts that improved my understanding of React, Node.js, and cloud-deployment best-practices. Across these roles, I developed technical skills such as API integration, cloud deployment pipelines, and database optimization, but I also developed non-technical skills, including Agile teamwork, effective communication with stakeholders, and providing deliverables within deadlines. These co-op experiences added value to my knowledge and confidence in applying AWS, DevOps, and AI tools in practical contexts, and I expect to refer and rely on this knowledge while our team builds, tests, and deploys the senior design project. In many ways, my internships have taught me how to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry-grade implementation.

**Paragraph 4 – Motivation**  
I am excited about this project, because it relates to my interests in artificial intelligence, cloud technology, and workshop developing economies to solve real problems. University students already need to work hard to keep on top of their classwork, deadlines, and facilities on campus. A personalized assistant would relieve students of much of that burden. In this regard, I am very excited about the potential of creating more than just a proof of concept; I am excited that this project has real potential to evolve into a real product for student use on campus. I am also excited about the opportunity to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of AWS services, as it aligns with my dreams to continue working in the cloud engineering and AI space. I also think there is something uniquely profound about combining a technical challenge with a real-world applicable challenge. I am very passionate about this project, because I have the opportunity to create something tangible and practical, and to show that I can produce in the area of software engineering and AI.

**Paragraph 5 – Preliminary Approach and Evaluation**  
First of all, we are going to build a working MVP that connects voice-interactions with calendar and course inputs. In between we will build the website frontend and plug various AWS services like Cognito for authentication, Transcribe for speech-to-text, Bedrock for reasoning, and Polly for text-to-speech. And at the same time we will look at Google, Microsoft and Canvas RESTful APIs for background support on querying schedules and assignments. Once we achieve MVP status we will look to expand the system through SageMaker-models that deploy the system with the intent classifier and document retriever values for accuracy, adaptability etc. So ultimately I expect our critical deliverables to be a working prototype demonstration, an architecture running on AWS, and some definable metrics for improvement on success rates for student queries. I will determine if I have been successful through my individual contributions - whether it is authentication-flow, data-caching, or api elicitations - for reliability, integration with my teammates designs, and with a contribution to the advancement of everyone. I will know I have done great if the assistant gives reliable and timely correct information consistently and the team is excited to present this project as a professional, end-to-end deployment.
