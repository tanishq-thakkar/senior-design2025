Individual Capstone Assessment

Introduction
Our senior design project, Unisync, is a campus-specific, secure, and personalized voice assistant designed to help University of Cincinnati students streamline their academic and daily campus life. Built on AWS AI/ML tools and powered by large language models, Unisync will answer day-to-day questions, integrate securely with Canvas and student calendars, and reduce friction in accessing essential information. From my perspective, this project aligns with my interests in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and full-stack development, while also offering a chance to directly improve student experiences on campus. By focusing on usability, security, and personalization, we hope to create a tool that feels intuitive and supportive for Bearcats navigating the demands of college life. For me, this is not only a technical challenge but also a meaningful opportunity to give back to my university community.

Academic Preparation
Throughout my college career, I have gained a strong foundation in the areas most relevant to building Unisync. My coursework in cloud computing has given me an understanding of how to design, deploy, and manage scalable systems, which is critical for a voice assistant that may need to serve many users simultaneously. I also studied artificial intelligence and machine learning, which deepened my knowledge of natural language processing, search techniques, and model integration—all central to Unisync’s functionality. In addition, my work in software engineering and scalable software architecture has prepared me to design modular systems that can grow with new features and adapt to user needs. These academic experiences taught me not only the technical skills to implement AI-driven systems but also the importance of software design principles like reliability, maintainability, and efficiency. Taken together, my studies have positioned me well to contribute meaningfully to both the technical and design aspects of our project.

Professional Experience
My co-op experiences have reinforced these academic foundations with real-world applications. On my first co-op at the University of Cincinnati IT team in Baldwin Library, I worked on software development while also teaching students interested in Python, machine learning, and AI. This built my ability to explain technical concepts clearly and made me more comfortable working in team settings where communication matters as much as code. Later, at Siemens Technology & Innovation, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern focused on Generative AI and Cloud Computing. There, I contributed to projects in localization and AI infrastructure, gaining exposure to Azure OpenAI, Cosmos DB, and scalable AI deployment. These experiences not only honed my backend and cloud development skills but also taught me the importance of integrating security and compliance into every step of AI system design. Both roles gave me the technical and non-technical skills—problem-solving, collaboration, and adaptability—that will directly guide my work on Unisync.

Motivation
I am highly motivated to participate in the Unisync project because it represents the perfect overlap of my skills, experiences, and personal mission. As a student, I have seen firsthand how fragmented campus information can be—whether it’s finding the right resource on Canvas, keeping track of deadlines, or scheduling advising appointments. Creating a voice assistant that securely integrates this information into a single, conversational interface excites me because it has the potential to genuinely improve student life. I am also inspired by the technical challenge of building a system that balances natural language understanding, real-time data integration, and strong security practices. The chance to build something that I, along with thousands of other students, would actually use every day is a strong motivator to push for excellence.

Preliminary Approach and Self-Evaluation
My approach to designing our solution will be to prioritize modularity and scalability from the beginning. I plan to focus on integrating AI/ML models with backend APIs and ensuring secure connections to systems like Canvas and university calendars. We will start with core use cases—such as retrieving assignments, class schedules, and campus resources—and expand incrementally as we validate performance and usability. I expect our results to include a fully functional prototype with measurable improvements in information accessibility and student satisfaction. To evaluate my contributions, I will measure both technical milestones (such as latency benchmarks and accuracy of responses) and team-oriented outcomes (such as code quality, documentation, and effective collaboration). I will know I have done a good job if our system not only functions reliably but also feels intuitive and valuable to students who test it.
