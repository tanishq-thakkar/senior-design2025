**Optimized Total:** **$100-300/month**

---

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### For MVP/Development:
1. ✅ **Use AWS Free Tier aggressively** - Most services have generous free tiers
2. ✅ **Use Claude Haiku** instead of Sonnet (10x cheaper, still very capable)
3. ✅ **Skip OpenSearch** - Use DynamoDB queries for MVP
4. ✅ **Skip SageMaker** - Implement ML features later
5. ✅ **Use Web Speech API** (browser-based) instead of Transcribe for MVP
6. ✅ **Cache common responses** to reduce Bedrock API calls
7. ✅ **Host frontend on Vercel/Netlify** (free) instead of CloudFront

### For Production:
1. ✅ **Implement response caching** - Cache common queries (e.g., "What's due this week?")
2. ✅ **Optimize prompts** - Shorter prompts = fewer tokens = lower costs
3. ✅ **Batch API calls** - Combine multiple Canvas/Calendar requests
4. ✅ **Use provisioned capacity** for DynamoDB if usage is predictable
5. ✅ **Monitor and set billing alerts** - AWS Budgets can alert at $10, $25, $50 thresholds
6. ✅ **Use AWS Cost Explorer** to track spending by service

## AWS Credits & Educational Discounts

### AWS Educate / AWS Academy
- **AWS Educate:** $75-200 in credits for students
- **AWS Academy:** Additional credits for academic projects
- **Contact:** UC IT or your professor to see if UC has AWS Academy partnership

### AWS Activate (Startups)
- Not applicable for student projects, but worth checking if you form a startup

### AWS Free Tier
- Most services have 12-month free tier
- Some services (Cognito, DynamoDB) have permanent free tier
- **Recommendation:** Use separate AWS accounts for development vs. production to maximize free tier usage

---

## Alternative Cost-Saving Strategies

### 1. Use Free/Cheaper Alternatives
- **Speech-to-Text:** Browser Web Speech API (free) → Transcribe later
- **Text-to-Speech:** Browser SpeechSynthesis API (free) → Polly later
- **Frontend Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify (free) instead of S3+CloudFront
- **Domain:** Use free subdomain or university-provided domain

### 2. Hybrid Approach
- **Development:** Use free alternatives (Web Speech API, browser TTS)
- **Production:** Migrate to AWS services (Transcribe, Polly) for better quality

### 3. Phased Rollout
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Text-only chat, no voice → **$2-5/month**
- **Phase 2:** Add voice input (Web Speech API) → **$2-5/month**
- **Phase 3:** Add voice output (Polly) → **$2-25/month**
- **Phase 4:** Migrate to Transcribe → **$25-100/month**

---

## Budget Recommendations

### For Senior Design Project (6-12 months):

**Minimum Budget:** $50-100 total
- Covers MVP development and demo
- Most services in free tier
- Bedrock costs for testing

**Recommended Budget:** $200-500 total
- Covers full development cycle
- Allows for production testing
- Buffer for unexpected costs

**Ideal Budget:** $500-1,000 total
- Covers full production deployment
- Allows for scaling and optimization
- Includes domain and additional services

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Set Up AWS Budgets
1. Create budget alerts at $10, $25, $50, $100 thresholds
2. Monitor daily spending in AWS Cost Explorer
3. Set up CloudWatch billing alarms

### Cost Tracking
- Use AWS Cost Explorer to track spending by service
- Tag resources by project/environment (dev, prod)
- Review costs weekly during development

---

## Summary

**MVP/Development (Recommended):** **$2-5/month** (~$24-60/year)  
**Production Demo (100-500 students):** **$25-180/month** (~$300-2,160/year)  
**Full Production (1,000+ students):** **$100-300/month** (optimized) or **$277-809/month** (full features)

**Key Takeaway:** For a senior design project, you can build a fully functional MVP for **under $100 total** by leveraging AWS free tiers and cost optimization strategies. The largest cost driver is **Amazon Bedrock (AI)** - use Claude Haiku and optimize prompts to keep costs low.
