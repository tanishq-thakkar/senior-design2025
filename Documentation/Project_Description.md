Project Topic Area

UniSync is a secure, campus-oriented virtual assistant designed to enhance the daily experience of Bearcats by reducing fragmentation across digital academic tools. Students currently rely on multiple platforms—Canvas for coursework, Outlook for communication, Teams for collaboration, and separate services for scheduling and campus updates. This constant context switching creates inefficiency, increases cognitive load, and often results in missed information or deadlines.

Our solution aims to unify these core services into one intelligent interface powered by AWS AI/ML, large language models, and natural language understanding. UniSync will enable students to interact through both text and voice commands, allowing them to check assignments, view upcoming deadlines, retrieve class announcements, manage calendars, send communications, locate campus resources, and more—without switching between apps. The assistant will learn user preferences over time, offering personalized workflows while maintaining strong data security and privacy considerations.

The long-term vision of UniSync is to become a seamless digital companion for UC students, providing fast access to information, improved task organization, and a more intuitive way to manage academic and campus life. By centralizing essential tools, UniSync reduces friction, saves time, and empowers students to stay organized, focused, and informed.
